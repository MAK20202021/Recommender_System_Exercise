# Recommender_System_Exercise

This exercise gives the idea of cleaning, tokenization, workflow and optimization of the process through feature union, custom transformer and Machine Learning Pipeline.
This provides the concepts of estimator objects which may be classification, regression or clustering algorithm or a transformer that extracts or filters important features from the raw data. Here, we used three estimators -- Countervectorizer, TfidfTransformer and RandomForestClassifier. We have utilized Pipeline library to optimize the overall workflow for simplicity, automation of repetitive steps, easily understanding. We also used Feature Union and custom transformer, at last we have got concepts of Grid search which allows to check many parameters thoroughly for data transformations and estimators.

## Project Motivation
Machine Learning Pipeline provides the optimized model to predict the possible outcomes from the raw data. It utilizes all the important libraries such as word_tokenize, Pipeline, FeatureUnion, GridSearchCV. This exercise is a good combination of utilizing all these libraries and creating custom transformer and utilizing different estimators.
